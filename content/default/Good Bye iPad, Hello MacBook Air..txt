#Good Bye iPad, Hello MacBook Air.

Last week i wrote about a little experiment in  using an iPad to replace my laptop outright. I thought it would be useful to share the outcome.

*Its not for me, but its not to bad*

## You can.

I can get buy with the iPad. It provides all of the *functionality* i need for my personal computing. But the _form factor_ and _software limitatons_ mean its a little to early for me to  _comfortable_ using the iPad as my main machine.

 I used it for MSN, writing, browsing the web and, twitter, email, RSS feeds and a dozen things other. For most of these things it was great. But i really struggled to get comfortable with the iPad. This comfort was in two places, physical and software.
 
  ### Physical comfort.
  
   Sitting on the sofa (resting the iPad on my legs or the arm of the chair) for writing was not very pleasant. After less than an evenig i was in serious pain.
   
    There are other options i know (go sit at the desk, or buy a laptop style base) but these kinda deafted the point of the iPad for me. If i wanted to be chained to the desk then i mas as well use the iMac (better keyboard), if i need to buy a case to make it "look" like a laptop i may as well just get a laptop.
    
    Sitting with the iPad for extended sessions was less comfortable than sitting with a MacBook. I can have both so why not.
    
   ### Software.
    
     The tools avaliable on the iPad are pretty amazing. For example, writing an article in byword, then taking and manipulating screen shots (i could not find a tool for this) then uploading those screen shots to my CMS. Then also making little tweaks in Coda.  
      
      However, the experience moving around felt very slow and clunky. Either using swipes or double tapping the home button i often got it wrong. 
      
      To be clear, these things will be features for others. But for me it was emmensely frustrating.
      
 ### Verdict.
 
 I could use the iPad as my main machine, but the limitation in my comfort mean that right now i _prefer_ to use a laptop. It's what works for me. 
 
If i had given the iPad more time then i am sure i would have adjusted. However, i dont think i would have become that much more comfortable. 

I will continue to use the iPad for all the things above an many more besides. But forcing myself to use something i find frustrating in the interest of "simplicty" feels a little backwards.
