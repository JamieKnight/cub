I have been stuck at home ill this week and bored out of my skull. Rather than waste the time between vomiting i decided to explore how the new Mac mini performs. Can the Mac mini beat the iMac for home users?

What i had seen as a straight forward comparison is proving to be far more nuanced. So much so i have backed out of selling my iMac. So lets go on and have a look.

### What's it for.
My needs are pretty simple, mostly media serving and management with occasional iOS & web development. Its nice for the odd gaming session too.

### Balence of performance.
So with my needs in mind, how does the mini and iMac compare? The answers is kinda complex. Its all about balence.

The iMac and Mac mini are tuned for different things. The iMac is more balanced but pays for it by being slower at transcoding and consuming more energy. The Mac mini is less balenced. It offers great CPU performance but is down on memory and graphics power as tested.

The Mac mini is very impressive, its 3 generations newer than the iMac and its energy consumption is very impressive. Ultimately its a mobile chip and it outperforms a 2 year old desktop chip. Thats remarkable.

For pure media use the Mac mini is not a bad fit. The lack of optical drive does not effect me and the transcoding speed is impressive. However, the graphics let it down for anything more than basic media use. While it plays back bluray rips smoothly, its limited for gaming. 

One thing to note before i move on is that the new Mac mini has a bug with wake on wireless. A media machine spends most of its time idle so being able to go to sleep and resume is very important. I have been unable to get the Mac mini to wake from sleep over the network.

### Vaule and flexibility
I paid £610 for the Mac Mini, thats a lot of money for what the mini offers. If size is the most important factor it may be justified but for my use it offers poor value. Selling the iMac will net me about £815 as my boyfriend put 10% into buying it.

That makes the Mini £205 cheaper, it's good but i'm not convinced it makes up for the odd balence. The iMac is a better fit for my needs and arguably far more flexable. That £205 buys you much improved graphics, more memory and that stunning 27" Screen.

One thing which has caused me much deliberation of the last week is the cost of flexibility. The iMac is flexible, it gives me a ready to go production machine should i return to freelancing and leaves more options on the table when it comes to gaming and other uses.

### Buying Recomendations
So, lets say your in my position. You have £900 to spend on a Mac for media duties should you go for a cheaper Mini or an older 2nd hand iMac.

If you want something to go under the telly or really value small size the mac mini is an option. Its expensive but it should last a good long time. If you want a little more flexibility a refurbished MacBook Air is even more flexible for around £80 more.

If your looking for a more all around home desktop then the iMac is impressive. The screen alone is worth the upgrade price, the graphics and RAM just sweeten the deal.

I have been considering selling the iMac for a while, being underused it felt like a waste. However this experiment has shown me that the iMac's flexibility is worth something. A few days with the alternative has reminded me that a mac hooked up to a TV is pretty difficult to work on.

### Final Words
For me, the conclusion is now clear. The iMac offers flexibility and that amazing screen for a resonable cost premuim. I wish i had been a little less hasty arranging the sale of the iMac, luckily i was able to pull out but it's left me feeling bad for the chap i left hanging. I'm going to return the Mac mini and wait out this generation of Mac hardware entirely.
